# RomCom
Mod 1

## Abstract:
This application creates random and custom romance novel covers.  

Users can generate random covers from existing stored data (click "Show New Random Cover") or create a custom book from user-added data ("Make Your Own Cover" tab).  

User inputs are stored and available for use when generating random covers (Note: user input data and Saved Covers do not persist on page load).

Users can also save covers to display in a 'View Saved Covers" view.  In the "View Saved Covers" view, users can enlarge the cover by clicking on it.  To unsave the cover, double -click on the cover.
